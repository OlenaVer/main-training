    <p>The Simpsons (often shortened to Simpsons) is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox
        Broadcasting Company. The main characters are a satire of a working-class family, consisting of Homer, Marge,
        Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The series lampoons many aspects of American culture, society, politics, and history.

        The cartoon made its debut as 60-second animated bumpers for The Tracey Ullman Show, with the first short airing
        on April 19, 1987. The shorts were then expanded into a full-length 30-minute television spin-off by 20th
        Century Fox, first airing on December 17, 1989. As of 2021, 32 seasons have aired, with the 33rd airing since
        September 26.

        The series currently holds the record for the longest-running prime-time sitcom in the US, running for 32 years
        and 33 seasons, as well as three seasons of shorts since 1989, and becoming the longest-running program on
        FOX.</p>

    <p>Marjorie Jacqueline "Marge" Simpson (née Bouvier[11]; born March 19) is the homemaker and matriarch of the
        Simpson family. She is also one of the five main characters in The Simpsons TV series. Marge is 36 years of age.
        She and her husband Homer have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Marge is the moralistic force in her
        family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain order in
        the Simpson household. Aside from her duties at home, Marge has flirted briefly with a number of careers ranging
        from a police officer to an anti-violence activist.</p>

    <p>Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9)[9] is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the
        two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.

        In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called
        Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard
        achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral
        center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to
        hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In
        school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only
        a few friends. She focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is
        already a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out to
        those who she deems lower than her or even above her. She has extreme jealously from time to time and will do
        whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the
        intelligent one who usually thinks things through.</p>

    <p>Margaret Evelyn[10] Lenny "Maggie" Simpson[11] (born January 12, 1989) is the 1-year old daughter and youngest
        child of Marge and Homer Simpson, the baby sister to Bart and Lisa Simpson and one of the five main characters
        of The Simpsons. She is often seen sucking on her pacifier, and when she walks, she trips over her clothing and
        falls on her face. Because she rarely ever talks, Maggie is the least seen and heard in the Simpson family.
        Maggie is the very young, infant age of 1.</p>
